For these two temporal knowledge graphs, the raw text of edge labels (edge categories) is the same as its edge text descriptions in the relation_text.csv file.
Note that if you need, you can also construct more coarse-grained edge categories based on the first two positions of CAMEO-Code. 
Specifically, the text description of each edge can be projected to a CAMEO-Code based on CAMEO-Event-Data-Codebook, 
and the first two positions of CAMEO-Code indicate the coarse-grained descriptions of this relation.
For example, the text descriptions "012: Make pessimistic comment" and "013: Make optimistic comment" both belongs to "01: MAKE PUBLIC STATEMENT".
